## Datasource Configuration

Notify assumes you have a postresql database to connect too.
This is known as the `datasource` in the `backend` configuration.

To configure your datasource connection, update the `local.yaml` file in the configuration directory with connection details to your database.
```
datasource:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 5432
  username: "postgres"
  password: "password"
  database_name: "dashboard"
```
We recommend using readonly credentials for production environments.

## Creating SQL Queries

Notify uses SQL queries to retrieve data from your datasource.
There are two types of queries
1. Recipient Queries
Allows you to customise who receives a notification based on an SQL Query against your datasource.
2. Data Queries
Allows you to customise the data that is sent in a notification based on an SQL Query against your datasource.

Sql Queries are parameterised using [tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/).

For example, if you wanted to send a notification to all users who's accounts are part of a group you could use the following query:
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE group = {{ group }}
```

By specifiying `{{ group }}` in the query, you can pass in a value for `group` when you send a notification.
Any sets of double curly braces `{{ }}` will be replaced with the value you pass in, and by adding double curly braces to your query, notify will assume that this parameter is required.

Note: Parameters are always assumed to be strings, if you want to use a parameter as a number, you'll need to cast it to a number in your query.

Something like this...
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE group = {{ group }} LIMIT CAST ('{{ limit }}' AS INTEGER)
```

## Telegram Bot
To configure telegram, you need to create a bot and get a token.

To create a bot open a telegram chat to @BotFather
Create a new bot with the command `/newbot`

BotFather will ask you for a username for the bot, call it something like `notify_YOURNAME_bot`

BotFather will then give you a token, copy this token and add it to your local.yaml configuration file.

```
telegram:
  token: "ABIGLONGSTRINGOFRANDOMCHARACTERSHERE"
```

To use your new bot within telegram groups, you may need to disable privacy mode using the command `/setprivacy` in a chat with @BotFather.
See: https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather and https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#privacy-mode

## Setting up telegram recipients
To add a telegram chat to your notify server, all you need to do is chat with the bot you created earlier, or add it to a group chat.

> Note: You can also ask the bot for the chatid from telegram by sending the command `/chatid` to the bot. Which can be useful when configuring other tools.
